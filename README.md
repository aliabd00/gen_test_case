# Automatic Generation of Interlocking Tests for Digital Substation for Integration With StationScout

 For testing an input file of test steps is provided: 7-Interlocking Q01_QB1 Close copy.xlsx

This file comes with a description of which signal addresses belong to which group types and is therefore suitable for "Generate_test_case_import_groupT.py" and "GUI_test.py". 

For using the more automatic version, "Generate_Test_Case_Ver5.py", that automatically extracts the group types, please test it using the other Excel file provided "Expanded_test.xlsx", as this one does not contain the group type information.

The SCD file provided is compatible with all the scripts.
